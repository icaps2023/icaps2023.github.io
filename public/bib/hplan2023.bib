  abstract  = {In HTN planning the choice of decomposition methods used to refine compound tasks is key to finding a valid plan. Based on inferred preconditions and effects of compound tasks, we propose a look-ahead technique for search-based total-order HTN planning that can identify inevitable refinement choices and in some cases dead-ends. The former occurs when all but one decomposition method for some task are proved infeasible for turning a task network into a solution, whereas the latter occurs when all methods are proved infeasible. We show how it can be used for pruning, as well as to strengthen heuristics and to reduce the search branching factor. An empirical evaluation proves its potential as incorporating it improves an existing HTN planner such that it is the currently best performing one in terms of coverage and IPC score.}

  abstract  = {In this paper we study the computational complexity of several reasoning tasks centered at the bounded plan existence problem. We do this for standard classical planning and hierarchical task network (HTN) planning and each for the grounded and the lifted representation. Whereas bounded plan existence complexity is known for classical planning, it has not been studied yet for HTN planning. For plan verification, results were available for both formalisms except the lifted representation of HTN planning. We will thus present the lower bound and the upper bound of the complexity of plan verification in lifted HTN planning and provide novel insights into its grounded counterpart, in which we show that verification is not just NP-complete in the general case, but already for a severely restricted special case. Finally, we show the computational complexity concerning the optimality of a given plan, i.e., answering the question whether such a plan is optimal, and discuss its connection to the bounded plan existence problem.}
