The International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) is the premier forum for exchanging news and research results on the theory and applications of intelligent and automated planning and scheduling technology. ICAPS 2023 is part of the [ICAPS conference series](https://www.icaps-conference.org/conference-series/). After three years of virtual events, ICAPS 2023 will be a physical conference again. ICAPS 2023 will be held July 8-13, 2023, in Prague, Czech Republic.

The ICAPS 2023 program committee invites paper submissions related to automated planning and scheduling. Relevant contributions include, but are not limited to:

- Theoretical and empirical studies of planning and scheduling problems and algorithms;
- Novel techniques and approaches that extend the scope and scale of problems that can be solved;
- Analytic and implemented tools supporting automated planning and scheduling; 
- Studies of applying automated planning and scheduling technologies to significant problems with deep technical insight.
