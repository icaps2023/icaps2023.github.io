# HAXP: Human-Aware and Explainable Planning

ICAPS'23 Workshop \
Prague, Czech Republic \
July 9-10, 2023

**We merged with the Plan, Activity, and Intent Recognition ([PAIR](../pair)) Workshop**

## Aim and Scope of the Workshop

As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being adopted into application solutions, the challenge of supporting effective interactions with humans is becoming more apparent. Partly this is to support integrated working styles, in which humans and intelligent systems cooperate in problem-solving, but also it is a necessary step in the process of building and calibrating trust as humans migrate greater competence and responsibility to such systems. The International Workshop on Human-Aware and Explainable Planning (HAXP), formerly known as the Explainable AI Planning (XAIP) workshop, brings together the latest and best in human-AI interaction and explainability, in the context of planning, scheduling, RL and other forms of sequential decision-making process. The workshop is collocated with ICAPS, the premier conference on automated planning and scheduling. Learn more: [HAXP](https://haxp-workshop.web.app/)

## Important Dates

- Paper submission deadline: **March 31 UTC-12 (EXTENDED)**
- Notification of acceptance: May 01 UTC-12
- Camera-ready paper submissions: TBD
- Workshop date: TBD (July 8-13)

## Submission Details

We invite submissions of the following types:

- Full technical papers making an original contribution; up to 9 pages including references.
- Short technical papers making an original contribution; up to 5 pages including references.
- Position papers proposing HAXP challenges, outlining HAXP ideas, debating issues relevant to HAXP; up to 5 pages including references.

Submissions will be hosted on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=icaps-conference.org/ICAPS/2023/Workshop/HAXP)

Papers must be prepared according to the instructions for ICAPS 2023 (in AAAI format) available at: [Paper template](https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit23.zip)

Authors who are considering submitting to the workshop papers rejected from the main conference, please ensure you do your utmost to address the comments given by ICAPS reviewers. Please do not submit papers that are already accepted for the main conference to the workshop.

Every submission will be reviewed by members of the program committee according to the usual criteria such as relevance to the workshop, the significance of the contribution, and technical quality. Authors can select if they want their submissions to be single-blind or double-blind.

The workshop is meant to be an open and inclusive forum, and we encourage papers that report on work in progress or that do not fit the mold of a typical conference paper.

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop in order to present the paper. All participants need to register to the main ICAPS conference. There will be no separate registration required.

We are excited that ICAPS is going to be a physical conference this year. However, we understand that not everyone will be able to travel to Prague, due to factors such as personal health or travel restrictions. Although not guaranteed yet, there might be limited support for remote presentations for those who cannot attend the in-person event.
